* Introduction to Objects
** The progress of abstraction
   1. Everything is an boject
   2. A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending message
   3. Each object has its own memory made up of other objects
   4. Every object has a type
   5. All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages
** An object has an interface
** An boject provides services
** The hidden implementation
** Reusing the implementation
** Inheritance
** Is-a vs. is-like-a relationships
** Interchangeable objects with polymorphism
